The idea is similar\n","to the kind of image autoencoder we built in lecture: we will have an **encoder** that\n","maps a news headline to a vector embedding, and then a **decoder** that reconstructs\n","the news headline. Both our encoder and decoder networks will be Recurrent Neural Networks,\n","so that you have a chance to practice building\n","\n","- a neural network that takes a sequence as an input\n","- a neural network that generates a sequence as an output\n","\n","This assignment is organized as follows:\n","\n","- Question 1. Exploring the data\n","- Question 2. Building the autoencoder\n","- Question 3. Training the autoencoder using *data augmentation*\n","- Question 4.

Text Autoencoder (40%)\n","\n","Building a text autoencoder is a little more complicated than an image autoencoder like we did in class. So\n","we will need to thoroughly understand the model that we want to build before actually building it. Note that the best and fastest way to complete this assignment is to spend time upfront understanding the architecture. The explanations are quite dense, but it is important to understand the operation of this model. The rationale here is similar in nature to the `seq2seq` RNN model we discussed in class, only we are dealing with unsupervised learning here rather than machine translation. \n","\n","# Architecture description\n","Here is a diagram showing our desired architecture:\n","\n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1UaXAYQvmFbBcuSBQb7ozjSliuVn7bP1Q'>\n","\n","There are two main components to the model: the **encoder** and the **decoder**.\n","As always with neural networks, we'll first describe how to make\n","**predictions** with of these components. Let's get started:\n","\n","The **encoder** will take a sequence of words (a headline) as *input*, and produce an\n","embedding (a vector) that represents the entire headline. In the diagram above,\n","the vector ${\\bf h}^{(7)}$ is the vector embedding containing information about \n","the entire headline.  This portion is very similar\n","to the sentiment analysis RNN that we discussed in lecture (but without the fully-connected\n","layer that makes a prediction).\n","\n","The **decoder** will take an embedding (in the diagram, the vector ${\\bf h}^{(7)}$) as input,\n","and uses a separate RNN to **generate a sequence of words**. To generate a sequence of words,\n","the decoder needs to do the following:\n","\n","\n","1.   Determine the previous word that was generated. This previous word will act as ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$\n","   to our RNN, and will be used to update the hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$. Since each of our\n","   sequences begin with the `<bos>` token, we'll set ${\\bf x}^{(1)}$ to be the `<bos>` token.\n","2.   Compute the updates to the hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$ based on the previous hidden state\n","   ${\\bf m}^{(t-1)}$ and ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$. Intuitively, this hidden state vector ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$\n","   is a representation of *all the words we still need to generate*.\n","3. We'll use a fully-connected layer to take a hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t)}$, and determine\n","   *what the next word should be*. This fully-connected layer solves a *classification problem*,\n","   since we are trying to choose a word out of $K=$ `vocab_size` distinct words. As in a classification\n","   problem, the fully-connected neural network will compute a *probability distribution* over\n","   these `vocab_size` words. In the diagram, we are using ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$ to represent the logits,\n","   or the pre-softmax activation values representing the probability distribution.\n","4. We will need to *sample* an actual word from this probability distribution ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$.\n","   We can do this in a number of ways, which we'll discuss in question 3. For now, you can \n","   imagine your favourite way of picking a word given a distribution over words.\n","5. This word we choose will become the next input ${\\bf x}^{(t+1)}$ to our RNN, which is used\n","   to update our hidden state ${\\bf m}^{(t+1)}$, i.e., to determine what are the remaining\n","   words to be generated.\n","\n","We can repeat this process until we see an `<eos>` token generated, or until the generated\n","sequence becomes too long.\n","\n","# Training the architecture\n","While our autoencoder produces a sequence, computing the loss by comparing the complete generated sequence to the ground truth (the encoder input) gives rise to multiple challanges. One is that the generated\n","sequence might be longer or shorter than the actual sequence, meaning that there may\n","be more/fewer ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$s than ground-truth words. Another more insidious issue\n","is that the **gradients will become very high-variance and unstable**, because\n","**early mistakes will easily throw the model off-track**. Early in training,\n","our model is unlikely to produce the right answer in step $t=1$, so the gradients\n","we obtain based on the other time steps will not be very useful.\n","\n","At this point, you might have some ideas about \"hacks\" we can use to make training\n","work. Fortunately, there is one very well-established solution called\n","**teacher forcing** which we can use for training:\n","instead of *sampling* the next word based on ${\\bf z}^{(t)}$, we will forget sampling,\n","and use the **ground truth** ${\\bf x}^{(t)}$ as the input in the next step.\n","\n","Here is a diagram showing how we can use **teacher forcing** to train our model:\n"," \n","<img src='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1NXlimWaCviDfP8DHlIzyQR1Ie7sxfPuY'>\n","\n","We will use the RNN generator to compute the logits\n","${\\bf z}^{(1)},{\\bf z}^{(2)},  \\cdots {\\bf z}^{(T)}$.
